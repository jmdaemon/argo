# Interface

Argo will offer various functions for use:
1. Default file view mode
2. Tagged / Structured file view mode

## Widgets

### Nav Bar

The navigation bar will contain at least these buttons:
- Back button
- Forward button
- Home Button
- Parent folder

These buttons will navigate the current folder view accordingly.

### Directory Bar

The directory bar is used to select and navigate the currently open directory of files. It should:
- Display truncated file paths if the text will run "off screen".
- Display the miniature file icon at the start of the bar.
- Display the file paths separated by '>' marks, but on click/edit, show full filepaths with '/'

### Files View

The files view should:

- Display files with thumbnails
- Support separate "views" for files
    - Icon View mode that displays large icons & thumbnails front and center, with the filenames below
    - List View mode that displays small icons, with file attributes
- Show file attributes in columns: Name, Size, Type, Modified
- Be toggleable for different kinds of directories:
    - Folders with general files display using List View
    - Folders with images display using Icon View
    - Folders with audio files display using List View (but maybe offer different toggleable columns by default)
- List View:
- Files displaying with List View are not too big.
    - Columns have a set max limit of 64.
    - Anything that goes over this limit automatically is truncated
- Metadata containing layout settings for certain directories is saved locally.
- By default, Argo will choose the best layout settings automatically for the directory available.
- Argo offers a button to reset the layout settings for a directory.
